# A2SERVER

A2SERVER lets you use a [Raspberry Pi][], or almost any other computer, to
serve files to Apple IIgs and enhanced IIe computers on your network. You'll
also be able to boot into GS/OS or ProDOS 8 directly from tne network (no
drives needed). A2SERVER has been designed to be as easy to set up and use as
possible, and it's free.

<!--
A2SERVER is available as a Raspberry Pi installer, or a virtual machine which
runs on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, or Solaris computers, or as an easy-to-use
installer for Ubuntu or Debian Linux.
-->

 A2SERVER is based on open-source software, primarily [Netatalk][] 2.2.4,
 with [many utilities and enhancements][A2SERVER features] to make
 everything as easy as possible. (If you like A2SERVER, you might also want to
 check out [A2CLOUD][].)

<!--
If you haven't checked out A2SERVER in a while: it now runs on something
small, cheap, and silent, and every common LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridge now
works easily with a IIgs (as opposed to none previously). And A2SERVER
supports Wi-Fi, and can download and install GS/OS on your network drive for
you. Cool stuff!
-->

*Update 19-Mar-15: A2SERVER 1.2.2 is available. It has support for Raspberry
Pi 2 Model B and every other Raspberry Pi, and new command line options for
the installer script. To update, type `a2server-setup`.*

Choose how you'd like to use A2SERVER, and you'll be up and running shortly.

* [Virtual Machine][A2SERVER virtualbox] (for Mac OS X, Windows, Linux,
  Solaris)
