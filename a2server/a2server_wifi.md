# A2SERVER

While wired Ethernet is recommended, it's possible to use A2SERVER with Wi-Fi
if you have an Apple AirPort or Time Capsule. (A2SERVER won't work with most
non-Apple router and access point models, as they are not designed to handle
AppleTalk networking.)

To connect your Apple II via Wi-Fi, read how to [attach your Apple II to your
local network][A2SERVER lan].

If you want your A2SERVER machine (whether virtual, real, or Raspberry Pi) to
connect to your network via Wi-Fi, you first need to configure a Wi-Fi network
adapter via the instructions below. Once you've got that up and running, [log
in][A2SERVER commands] to A2SERVER and type `netatalk-wifi` to tell A2SERVER to use the Wi-Fi
interface *(if you get "command not found", type `a2server-setup` to refresh
the command list).*{: .fine-print }

Setting up Wi-Fi on your A2SERVER machine:

__Multiple AirPorts__{: .uline }  
As an alternative to using a Wi-Fi network adapter, any of the machine types
below can work with Wi-Fi simply by connecting the wired Ethernet interface to
another AirPort and setting up an [extended network][AirPort extended network] (if all AirPorts are
802.11n models), or a [WDS][AirPort WDS] (if any AirPort is an 802.11g model).

__Raspberry Pi__{: .uline }  
[We got a whole page about that.][ivanx rpi-wifi]
{: .space-after }

__Virtual machine__{: .uline }  
On a virtual machine, A2SERVER won't work over Wi-Fi with the virtual network
interface, but you may, or may not, be able to use a USB Wi-Fi adapter
attached your VM's emulated USB port, and then follow the instructions below
for a real machine. Some adapters may have issues with specific virtual
machine software; for example, Atheros 9K based adapters [do not work with
VirtualBox][vbox atheros9k] or VMWare Fusion, though they do work with Parallels Desktop;
Realtek 81xx based adapters seem to work with VirtualBox (at minimum).

__Real machine (Intel or compatible)__{: .uline }  
On a standard computer with a native Linux installation, if you can get a
Wi-Fi adapter working, it will probably work with A2SERVER. Instructions will
vary by distribution, but should be similar to [the guide for Raspberry
Pi][ivanx rpi-wifi], with a much wider range of usable adapters.

If those steps don't work, type `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`, and edit
the file so it contains a sequence of lines that look like this:  
`allow-hotplug wlan0`  
`iface wlan0 inet dhcp`  
`wpa-ssid MyNetworkName` (substitute your Wi-Fi network name)  
`wpa-psk abcdefgh` (substitute your WPA password, or its 64-character hex
equivalent)

If you are using WEP encryption instead of WPA, replace the last two lines
with:   
`wireless-essid MyNetworkName` (substitute your Wi-Fi network name)  
`wireless-key abcde` (substitute your 5 or 13 character, or 10 or 26 hex byte, 
WEP password)

Spaces in the Wi-Fi network name or password may not work.

Remove any other chunks which mention wlan0, and save the file (press
control-w). Then type:  
`sudo ifdown wlan0; sudo ifup wlan0`

Finally, type `ip addr`. If you see an IP address for wlan0 (next to
"inet"), your Wi-Fi adapter is on your network, and you can disconnect your
Ethernet or serial cable. (If you don't seem to have internet access, type
`sudo shutdown -r now` to restart.)
