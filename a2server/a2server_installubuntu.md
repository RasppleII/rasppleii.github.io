# A2SERVER

These steps cover how to install Ubuntu Server Linux into your empty virtual or real machine. (The instructions are similar, but may vary somewhat, for Debian Linux.)
{: .space-after }

* Download [Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS][Ubuntu download], and burn it to a CD if
  installing on a real machine; otherwise, attach the download to your
  virtual machine's CD/DVD drive.

<!-- space -->

* Click Start.
* Answer all the region related questions and choose to Install Ubuntu
  Server.
* For hostname, enter *a2server*
* Under Partition Disks, choose "Guided - use entire disk" (no LVM).
* Choose SCSI1 (or whatever other disk appears), and (two screens later)
  confirm "Write the changes to disks."{: .space-after }

<!-- space -->

* If you are installing Debian, and are prompted for a domain name or
  the root user password, leave them blank.
* Enter *user1* as the full name for the new user, and as the username
  for your account
* Choose *apple2* as the password, verify by retyping, and then confirm
  weak password
* Choose not to encrypt your home directory
* If you require an HTTP proxy, enter it, or leave it blank if not.
* Choose yes to Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record

<!-- space -->

* Choose no automatic updates
* Choose OpenSSH under Software Selection (and, for Debian, Standard
  System Utilities)
* Click Continue to reboot

<!-- space -->

* When prompted, log in with username *user1* and password *apple2*.
* If you installed Debian rather than Ubuntu, type:  
  `sudo sed -i '0,/-eq 0/s/-eq 0/-ge 0/' /etc/profile`{: .language-bash }
* When you're back at the prompt, type `sudo shutdown -h now` which
  will turn off the (virtual) machine.
* Recommended: If you are using a virtual machine, take a snapshot you
  can return to this point if necessary.
